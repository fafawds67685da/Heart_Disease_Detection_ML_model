Hello there !
With a lot of hardwork WE were able to develop this prototype for Detecting Heart related complexities
currently as one can see , this prototype is still in its early developement phase, but still
we were determined enough to develop a linear regression algorithm for this 11 parameter model !!
we aim to update and hence optimize this model , by goin beyond and adding more suitable and appropriate parameters,
ones that can really help to diagnose at the earliest
currently it can only be used by a health care professional due to its definitive parameters

But , as we dive deeper into the Machine learning , we plan to adopt some more efficient algorithm inspired by logistic regression or deep learning

In the end , with the appropriate dataset, we ultimately aim to develop a fine ML model , which can be used as
HOUSEHOLD DIAGNOSE SOFTWARE , with some handy parameters

we plan to use such parameters , which are conviniently known to the user, and we will evaluate them in a way , that we can achieve our result
and help and save lives and ultimately lead to a better lifestyle !

Hope the Vultr communty find this project fine capable enough to advance through its developement phase , and also worthy of their amazing services !

Thank You!
